So far the tool handles both the MySQL and SQLite syntaxes, but it is planned to handle the Postgre one as soon as the formers will be considered as stable. The input of the tool can be either a sql file export, or given the version you downloaded, connect to either a MySQL running instance or an existing SQLite database.
